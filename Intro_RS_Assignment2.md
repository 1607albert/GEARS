# Introduction to Remote Sensing of the Environment
Assignment 2 - Spectral properties and indices
--------------


## Objective


The objective of this assignment is to reinforce your knowledge of spectral properties and indices through practical application. The skills required have been covered in Labs 1-3, but some further exploration and independent research will be required on your part. Talk to your classmates and use the Discussion board if you get stuck.

## Assignment
### Location

The area of interest for this assignment is the area between berry Springs and Manton Dam in the Northern Territory. The coordinates of the area of interest are:

1: [130.887,-12.669]
2: [130.887,-12.927]
3: [131.156,-12.927]
4: [131.156,-12.669]

### Imagery

Two Sentinel-2 scenes need to be used for your analysis. One collected on 25 April 2018, and one collected on 24 June 2018.

### Tasks





Remember that recorded videos of previous tutorials can be found on my YouTube Channel's [Introduction to Remote Sensing of the Environment Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf6lu3bePWHDi3-lrSqiyInMGQXM34TSV).
