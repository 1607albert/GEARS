# Introduction to Remote Sensing of the Environment
Assignment 2 - Spectral properties and indices
-----------------


## Objective


The objective of this assignment is to reinforce your knowledge of spectral properties and indices through practical application. The skills required have been covered in Labs 1-3, but some further exploration and independent research will be required on your part. Talk to your classmates and use the Discussion board if you get stuck.

## Assignment
### Location

The area of interest for this assignment is the area between berry Springs and Manton Dam in the Northern Territory. The coordinates of the area of interest (AOI) are:

1: [130.887,-12.669]
2: [130.887,-12.927]
3: [131.156,-12.927]
4: [131.156,-12.669]

### Imagery

Two Sentinel-2 scenes need to be used for your analysis. One collected on 25 April 2018, and one collected on 24 June 2018.

### Tasks

1. Explore the area in the April image and take note of the different landcover types and land-uses with the AOI.
2. Visually identify the following 7 landcover classes:
    - water
    - savanna woodland
    - monsoon forest
    - mangroves
    - mango orchard
    - sports field
    - cleared paddock
3. Plot the spectral response curve for each of the 7 classes for the April image
4. Plot the spectral response curve for each of the 7 classes for June images
5. Discuss how the spectral response changes with season for each classes
7. Produce a map of NDVI and NDWI for April and June over the AOI. Use a brown>yellow>green colour scale for the NDVI map, and a white>purple>blue colour scale for NDWI. Discuss the changes that you observe in NDVI and NDWI between April and June.
8. Calculate the Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR) for April and June. Use the following equation to calculate deltaNBR, which is an estimate of fire severity:

deltaNBR = prefireNBR - postfireNBR

9. Produce a map of deltaNBR for the AOI with a colour scale from green>yellow>red.
10. Examine the spectral response curves for some areas with a high deltaNBR and discuss why these changes occur after fire.
